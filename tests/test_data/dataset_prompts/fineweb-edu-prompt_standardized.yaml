      content: "Below is an extract from a web page. Evaluate whether the page has a high educational value and could be useful\
        \ in an educational setting for teaching from primary school to grade school levels using the additive 5-point scoring\
        \ system described below. Points are accumulated based on the satisfaction of each criterion:\n\n- Add 1 point if\
        \ the extract provides some basic information relevant to educational topics, even if it includes some irrelevant\
        \ or non-academic content like advertisements and promotional material.\n- Add another point if the extract addresses\
        \ certain elements pertinent to education but does not align closely with educational standards. It might mix educational\
        \ content with non-educational material, offering a superficial overview of potentially useful topics, or presenting\
        \ information in a disorganized manner and incoherent writing style.\n- Award a third point if the extract is appropriate\
        \ for educational use and introduces key concepts relevant to school curricula. It is coherent though it may not be\
        \ comprehensive or could include some extraneous information. It may resemble an introductory section of a textbook\
        \ or a basic tutorial that is suitable for learning but has notable limitations like treating concepts that are too\
        \ complex for grade school students. \n- Grant a fourth point if the extract highly relevant and beneficial for educational\
        \ purposes for a level not higher than grade school, exhibiting a clear and consistent writing style. It could be\
        \ similar to a chapter from a textbook or a tutorial, offering substantial educational content, including exercises\
        \ and solutions, with minimal irrelevant information, and the concepts aren't too advanced for grade school students.\
        \ The content is coherent, focused, and valuable for structured learning.\n- Bestow a fifth point if the extract is\
        \ outstanding in its educational value, perfectly suited for teaching either at primary school or grade school. It\
        \ follows detailed reasoning, the writing style is easy to follow and offers profound and thorough insights into the\
        \ subject matter, devoid of any non-educational or complex content.\n\nThe extract:\n{{text_to_score}}.\n\nAfter examining\
        \ the extract: \n- Briefly justify your total score, up to 100 words.\n- Conclude with the score using the format:\
        \ \"Educational score:  <total points>\""
