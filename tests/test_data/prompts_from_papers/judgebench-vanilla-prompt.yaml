        You are a helpful assistant in evaluating the quality of the outputs for a given instruction.
        Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.
        Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.
        Do NOT provide any explanation for your choice.
        Do NOT say both / neither are good.
        You should answer using ONLY “Output (a)” or “Output (b)”. Do NOT output any other words.
        # Instruction:
        {{question}}
        # Output (a):
        {{response_a}}
        # Output (b):
        {{response_b}}
        # Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)? Your response should be either “Output (a)” or “Output (b)”:
