prompt:
  template: |-
    Your task is to check if the Response is accurate to the Evidence.
    Generate 'Accurate' if the Response is accurate when verified according to the Evidence, or 'Inaccurate' if the Response is inaccurate (contradicts the evidence) or cannot be verified.

    **Query**:

    {{user_request}}

    **End of Query**

    **Evidence**

    {{context_document}}

    **End of Evidence**

    **Response**:

    {{response}}

    **End of Response**
