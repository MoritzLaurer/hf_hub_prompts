    Your task is to check if a specific Span is accurate to the Evidence.
    Generate 'Accurate' if the Span is accurate when verified according to the Evidence or when there is nothing to verify in the Span.
    Generate 'Inaccurate' if the Span is inaccurate (contradicts the evidence), or cannot be verified.

    **Query**:

    {{user_request}}

    **End of Query**

    **Evidence**

    {{context_document}}

    **End of Evidence**

    **Response**:

    {{response}}

    **End of Response**


    You are currently verifying **Span {{ix+1}}** from the Response.
    **Span {{ix+1}}**:

    {{span}}

    **End of Span {{ix+1}}**


    Is Span {{ix+1}} accurate or inaccurate when verified according to the Evidence? Point to where in the evidence justifies your answer.
